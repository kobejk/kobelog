# Kobe's Log

Welcome to the repository for my personal blog. This project is a culmination of my interests in technology and cybersecurity, created using Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator written in Golang.

## About This Project

As I end my university studies, I've decided to create a blog to share my knowledge and insights about security and various technological topics that fascinate me. This blog serves multiple purposes:

- To cement my learning by writing about it.
- To provide valuable content to others interested in similar topics.
- To experiment with and showcase modern web technologies.
